# Finding a scale


- In addition to an instrument you develop yourself, your final projects require you to include two other constructs that come from established literature.

- Finding a validated instrument relevant to your topic may required a little detective work. 
- At a minimum, you want to find a citation for your scale, the question(s) used, and the scoring method.

# Finding a scale

Your best bet is probably going to be searching journal articles in the relevant field. Some good general search engines for academic research are:

-   [Google Scholar](https://scholar-google-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/).

-   [Web of Science](https://www-webofscience-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/wos/woscc/smart-search)

-   [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)


# Accessing library resources

- The UMD library provides access to a ton of scholarly sources. You can access these freely any time you're on campus.

- If you're not on campus, you can use the [UMD reload button](https://lib.guides.umd.edu/reload-button/home) to redirect your request through the library proxy.

## Examining the paper

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Academic articles tend to have a relatively consistent structure. You don't need to read the whole thing to get useful information.

- For our purposes here, the "methods" and "literature review" sections are probably the most important components.

## Questions to ask

- Is the scale widely used? The citation count for the original publication can be a good indicator.

## Questions to ask: versions


- Are there different versions of the scale that might be more relevant for your project? (shorter versions, updates, minor modifications for similar constructs)


## Questions to ask: validation studies

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Have there been additional validation studies?

- Widely used scales might have been subjected to multiple validation studies to examine how well they work and what they measure

## Questions to ask: validation studies

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Dimensionality refers to the estimated number of latent constructs measured by the instrument (this is typically measured with some form of factor analysis)
- Unidimensionality indicates that there's evidence that a single trait explains most of the variation in responses to the scale items.

## Questions to ask: validation studies

::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Evidence of construct validity comes from examining how well this measure correlates with other things that should be associated with social media addiction.

- (The abstract says these are "pooled" because they're based on a weighted average of multiple studies.)

## Questions to ask: validation studies

::::: {.columns}

- Test-retest reliability is an indication of how closely responses correlate between follow-ups. 

- (There weren't enough papers to quantitatively evaluate this)

## Questions to ask: validation studies

- Social media addiction is not a recognized psychiatric disorder, so this isn't a clinical diagnostic tool, but it appears good enough to use to draw conclusions about problematic social media use in the population.

-   The Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences hosts an excellent [open-access repository for m measurement instruments](https://zis.gesis.org/?lang=en) along with citations and validation information. Note that some of these are not available in English.



## Questions

- What scale or scale(s) are available?

- Are the items accessible? Are there multiple versions? How many questions and how are they scored?

- Are there additional validation studies? Can you find discussions about the reliability or dimensionality of the measure?

- Is the scale widely used? Are there important criticisms or limitations mentioned? Is there a debate that warrants consideration? Competing measures?
