# Problematic Questions

How could we improve this question?

> Question: *Do you support or oppose restoring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran?* (Answers range from strongly support to strongly oppose)

## Problematic Questions: lack of context

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Even people who are familiar with the deal may not know the formal name, the "Iran nuclear deal" might be more common.

-   If feasible, a description of the policy may be more useful than just the name.

# Problematic Questions

*Are we spending too much money on welfare and national defense, or not enough?* (Answers range from "too little" to "too much")

## Problematic Questions: double-barreled

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   I might want to spend more on welfare and less on national defense, or vice versa.
-   At a minimum, we probably want to split these up. (The General Social Survey asks a whole series of spending questions like this)

# Problematic Questions

*Have you ever joined a political protest?* (options are "I have done this", "I might do this", or "I would never do this")

## Problematic Questions: non-exclusive categories

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   These response options aren't clearly mutually exclusive: I may have participated in the past but be unwilling to do so in the future. Or vice-versa.
-   Splitting this up or adding a full range of options could be better.

# Problematic Questions

*How often do you drink alcohol?* (options range from "Never" to "Frequently")

## Problematic Questions: ambiguous time frames

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Respondents can interpret the relevant time frame differently. Lifetime? In the last week?
-   Specifying some time frame can give you more consistent answers.

# Problematic Questions

*In the last six months, have you been a victim of a crime?* (options are "yes" or "no")

## Problematic Questions: context and recall

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Respondents may not see themselves as victims, may forget minor crimes, or may not immediately think of even major crimes as "criminal".
-   Surveys like the NCVS use examples and ask about specific aspects of each crime.

## Problematic Questions: loaded language

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Explicitly referencing loaded terms can make people less willing to give honest answers, especially on sensitive questions.
-   Respondents may genuinely not consider themselves drug abusers.

*Do you blame Democrats for the government shutdown?* (Answers are "Yes", "No", "Not sure")

## Problematic Questions: leading

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Mentioning one party here is likely to nudge respondents toward blaming Democrats
-   The response options would fail to capture the possibility of assigning equal blame to both parties.

# Question writing

There are no hard and fast rules here, sometimes a flawed question is still the best possible option, but there are some general best practices

# Question writing

-   Avoid ambiguous or emotionally charged language, especially when asking about a sensitive topic.
-   Provide context where needed, and choose familiar names instead of jargon.
-   Be specific about time frames.
-   Offer response options that are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.
-   Ask questions that only measure one "thing" at a time.
-   Keep things short.

# Question writing

Where possible, you should try to use an established measure instead of reinventing the wheel.

# How respondents think about questions

## Social Desirability

Everyone wants to be liked. Respondents will give answers that make them look good. Maybe even subconsciously.

### Social Desirability: voting

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   As many as half of non-voters will claim to have voted in survey questions.

-   [@hanmer2014experiments] randomly gave subtle and unsubtle hints that researchers might check voter roles.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/bogus_pipeline.png)

:::::

### Social Desirability: voting

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: nonincremental
-   Perhaps unsurprisingly, the desire to avoid being caught in a lie overwhelmed social desirability.

### Social Desirability: list-experiments

List-experiments are another option for dealing with sensitive topics by indirectly measuring preferences.

### Social Desirability: list-experiments

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Respondents are randomly assigned to receive only non-sensitive items, or non-sensitive items plus one sensitive question.

-   They only say how many items they agree with.

### Social Desirability: list-experiments

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.nonincremental}

-   The difference in the average count of items is used to estimate support.

### Social Desirability: some fixes

-   Taking the interviewer out seems to help a lot! This is less of a problem on online surveys.
-   Deliberately loading questions is another option (see the example marijuana question from the YRBSS)
-   For highly sensitive topics, list experiments can mitigate the problem.

## Fence siting

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some respondents may always pick the "neutral" option, if one is available.

-   One option is to eliminate the neutral option all together, but there's a trade-off here: some people genuinely don't have an opinion!

![](images/Likert-Scale-7-point-scales.webp){fig-align="center" width="60%"}
:::
:::::

## Acquiescence/naysaying

-   Some respondents may be prone to agree or disagree with everything. This could be because of their personality or a lack of attention.

### Acquiescence/naysaying: F-scale

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The F-scale was developed out of an early effort to understand the psychology of rank and file fascists.
-   30 agree/disagree items, with agreement indicating more authoritarian views.
-   Acquiescence bias would probably inflate the estimates of authoritarian attitudes.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/authoritarianism_fscale.png){fig-align="center" width="30%"}
:::
:::::

### Acquiescence/naysaying: some fixes

-   Balanced agree/disagree items: agreement could = more of a characteristic in some questions, and less of it in others. ("you can't trust strangers" and "most people are honest")

-   Forced choice: instead of agree/disagree, use either/or ("is it better to be obedient or creative?") or some other item-specific options ("always - never", "many - none", etc.)

## Careless responding

-   Respondents may get worn out, bored, or not really care to give accurate answers.

-   (this can be especially problematic for surveys that offer rewards for respondents.)

### Careless responding

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   In a 2022 online opt-in survey, Pew found that 5% of adults said they were licensed to operate a nuclear submarine.
-   The actual number would round to 0%

:::
:::::

### Careless responding: some fixes

-   Limiting the number of questions can help mitigate boredom.
-   Including some attention screens (questions with clear answers that disqualify inattentive respondents) or scales with some reverse-coded items.

# Multi-item measures

-   Complex concepts often require more than one thing to measure appropriately.

-   This can reduce measurement error, but it also gives us some options for validating measurements.

## Racial resentment

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Reported "old-fashioned" racism declined precipitously after the Civil Rights movement.

-   But most Americans continued to oppose programs designed to improve racial equality.

-   Symbolic racism (or racial resentment, or modern racism) is a proposed explanation for this phenomenon.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Symbolic Racism

Described as a blend of "anti-black affect" and "traditional conservatism" with four components:

-   "racial discrimination is no longer a serious obstacle to blacks’ prospects for a good life"
-   "blacks’ continuing disadvantages are largely due to their unwillingness to work hard enough."
-   "As a result, both their continuing demands and increased advantages are unwarranted"

. . .

[@henry2002symbolic]

### Symbolic Racism: Critiques

Some major critiques:

-   Questions are tautological

-   The questions mostly just measure conservatism.

-   The construct isn't really distinct from old-fashioned racism.
